Hey,
<br>
Google.
</h1>
</section>
<section class='summary'>
<p class='large'>I’m Amber, a people-first UX design leader with an intent attention to detail grounded by an understanding of the whole. Google’s innovation and user-centricity have inspired me for my entire career, and I am excited to show you what I can bring to your team.</p>
</section>
<section id='aboutme'>
<h2 class='s4'>A little about me</h2>
<p>I’m a maker who loves solving problems through empathy, collaboration, and experiments. I love unearthing new insights and digging deep on a challenge, whether that’s creating a better team process, building a new service, or revamping an interaction. I’m an amalgamation: equal parts science and art. My psychology and medical background, melded with my UX and brand experience, gives me a unique perspective on people, their needs, and behaviors. I work hard, have an unflagging devotion to the user, and learn from my mistakes.</p>
<p>For the last three years, I’ve been leading the design team at Tuft & Needle. I’ve been responsible for both the visual design and UX of the brand. I love mentoring my team, but I also love getting my hands in the work.</p>
</section>
<section id='whygoogle'>
<h2 class='s4'>Why Google?</h2>
<p>You’re a forward-thinking company that champions the user and values design. You’ve solved incalculable needs for the last 22 years and continue to do so. You demand the best from your teams and push beyond what’s thought possible. Not only do you excel at digital interactions, but you extend your design philosophy elegantly to the physical, creating products that rival Rams and the greats. Ultimately, you need hard-working people who can bring a new perspective and continue crafting the future. I’d be honored to be one of those people.</p>
</section>
<section id='casestudies'>
<h2 class='s4'>A few case studies</h2>
<p>For the past three years, I’ve lead and mentored a team of 10 designers and producers while focusing on strategy. While this means I haven’t had time for much hands-on project work, my design skill set has continued to improve as I have guided my team through their projects.</p>
<p>The case studies below are projects where I was the lead designer. Admittedly, these aren’t recent. But hopefully, seeing where I was, with the knowledge of my leadership experience, you’re able to get a sense of my thought process and aptitude.</p>

<h2 class='s4'>Design principles</h2>
<p>In case you want to learn a little more, below are a handful of guiding principles that I use in my work:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fundamentals of human-centered design can and should be used by everyone. This is how we build meaningfully for people.</li>
<li>Companies should exist to make the world better in some way. And I want to be a part of the revolution, no matter how small or quiet.</li>
<li>Empathy, research, and testing are vital to good design. They help identify unmet human needs and solve them meaningfully.</li>
<li>Design should be intentional and essential. Every decision should be carefully considered and deliberate, the right amount of design for the problem.</li>
<li>Interactions should bring delight — whether overt or a subconscious relief at the ease of an action.</li>
<li>Collaboration and candid feedback make the work stronger. My job is to facilitate these conversations and use them to find the best way forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>“I have had the pleasure of working with Amber at various companies over the past few years and she’s been paramount to the success of the design team as a whole. Her ability to both strategically lead initiatives as well as contribute to the ground level design make her an irreplaceable team member. She’s always thoughtful with her approach and more importantly manages to get consensus fast because of her collaborative methods of ideation. I would work with Amber again in a heartbeat and highly recommend her to anyone looking for their next key player on their design team.”</p>

<p>“Amber has been my direct leader since 2018 when I joined the Tuft & Needle team as a UX Designer. Over time, I’ve continually been impressed and inspired by her exceptional leadership skills, especially during times of uncertainty. Amber has led the Design Team through a corporate merger, a design team restructuring defined by executive leadership, and a global pandemic. Throughout all of this, she has consistently advocated for the team and has made herself available at all times for candid conversations with team members; all while guiding the team to produce high-quality design work.</p>
<p>This strong leadership also extends to her approach to product and brand strategy. At the beginning of all projects, Amber ensures that designers are gaining a complete understanding of the problem and maintaining a strong advocacy for the user. Throughout projects, she consistently provides feedback that is both constructive for the project and instructive for the designer. When taking on her own projects, she follows this same strategy rigorously. I had the opportunity to work directly with Amber as she led a brand refocusing project, and I was in awe of her ability to easily transition from guiding designer-led projects to managing her own.</p>
<p>Personally, I consider Amber to be one of the most influential design and professional mentors that I’ve had in my career. She has been instrumental in building my UX design skills from my foundation in architecture and remains fully invested in my growth as a professional. Throughout my career, I’ve found that there are bosses and leaders in management roles, and Amber is certainly the latter.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had the privilege of working with Amber over the last four years at Tuft & Needle. Her excitement and passion for UX, brand, and strategy are contagious.</p>
<p>Amber’s mentorship has helped me grow in my visual and UX skills. She is the master of key commands and has a very detail-oriented eye for design elements and art direction. She has also coached me in becoming confident in public speaking and has shared her skillful strategy in presenting projects to teams and stakeholders.</p>
<p>She is a compassionate leader who wants to meet her team where they’re at and also creates goals to help the team get better through their daily craft. She’s someone you depend on to represent design at every level of the company because she cares deeply for the process, brand-perception, and business goal alignment.”</p>
